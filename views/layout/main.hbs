                        <p>
                            Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry,
                            in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects
                            of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; the phenomena include supernova
                            explosions, gamma ray bursts,&hellip;

                        <h3>Telescope</h3>
                        <p>
                            A telescope is an optical instrument that aids in the observation of remote objects by collecting electromagnetic radiation (such as visible light). The first known practical telescopes were invented in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century, by using glass lenses. They found use in both terrestrial applications and astronomy,&hellip;

                        <p>
                            A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals,&hellip;
