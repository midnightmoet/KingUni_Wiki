Using my cubicle to compose a skeleton code set up to modify to work for this project.  
Per instructor this would be a place to start for the approach.  Will modify as time goes on.
The project is due by September 1st.  Goal is to get done as much as possible BUT the final product
will be posted as a coding example that will be viewable.
